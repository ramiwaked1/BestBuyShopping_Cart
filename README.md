My project was to create a functional shopping cart using The BestBuy Store API to get the products live on a page using jQuery, HTML, CSS, Sass and Gulp.

I added the elements on the page with JS, a bit of HTML, and implemented a mobile-first, responsive layout (optimized for the three required screen sizes). This shopping cart page is responsive for mobiles, tablets and desktops. It even lets you add products to your functional shopping cart.

### Project Demonstrations

This project demonstrates the following:
- CSS reset
- background property
- use of box model
- use of css properties used for altering visual display of text
    - ie. font-family, font-style, text-transform, etc...
- uses custom fonts (@font-face)
- Icon fonts
- CSS3 properties such as box-shadow and border-radius
- Use Sass as a preprocessor, with CSS properly compiled and minified
- Uses flexbox layouts rather than floats
- Responsive and optimized for three screen sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop
- JS Usage:
    - Use Ajax to fetch data from the Best Buy products API endpoint
    - Only display a maximum of 10 products per category, and displays a photo associated with it, its name and price.
    - Transition users between UI states, starting where no products have been returned, and then subsequently transitioning where products populate the page product slider.

Functional requirements:
- Dynamically fetch products data and populate it in a webpage via the Best Buy Products API based a userâ€™s selection from a menu field
- This shopping cart page is responsive for mobiles, tablets and desktops. It even lets you add products to your functional shopping cart.
- Adds products to the cart and lets you update and remove them with some Javascript functions.
