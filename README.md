# Project 3: BestBuy Shopping Cart

My project was to create a functional shopping cart using The BestBuy Store API to get the products live on a page using jQuery, HTML, CSS, Sass and Gulp.

I added the elements on the page with JS, a bit of HTML, and implemented a mobile-first, responsive layout (optimized for the three required screen sizes). This shopping cart page is responsive for mobiles, tablets and desktops. It even lets you add products to your functional shopping cart.
